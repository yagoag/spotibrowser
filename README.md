# SpotiBrowser

![SpotiBrowser](screenshot.png)

This app will allow you to browse and filter the featured playlists on Spotify.

If you have the Spotify app installed in your computer, clicking a playlist will open it in your app.

The playlists will be updated every 30 seconds so you don't miss any new tunes on the playlists by Spotify.

## Running the service

First of all, you will need to update the `.env` file. I have left the file on the repo, so you know which variables you need to set. Some of them already have some defaults, which you usually wouldn't need to change.

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), so any commands in there will still work.

## What could have been done better

You can watch for new features and enhancements on the [Kanban](https://github.com/yagoag/spotify-featured-browser/projects/1) of the project
